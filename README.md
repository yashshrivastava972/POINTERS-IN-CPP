## Aim: To study and implement C++Pointer basics.

## Tool: VS CODE.

## Theory: 

### What is a Pointer?
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

•	Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. 
•	They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. 
•	Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 
•	The address of the variable you’re working with is assigned to the pointer variable that points to the same data type (such as an int or string).

 Key Concepts
- Declaration: type* ptr; — declares a pointer to a specific type.
- Address-of Operator (&): Gets the address of a variable.
- Dereference Operator (*): Accesses the value at the pointer's address.
- Null Pointer: A pointer that points to nothing (nullptr in modern C++).
- Pointer Arithmetic: You can increment/decrement pointers to traverse arrays.

### Advantages of Using Pointers in C++

1. Dynamic Memory Management
- Enables allocation and deallocation of memory at runtime using new and delete.
- Useful for creating flexible data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.

 2. Efficient Array and String Handling
- Pointers allow direct manipulation of arrays and strings.
- Enables faster traversal and modification using pointer arithmetic.

 3. Function Arguments: Pass-by-Reference
- Allows functions to modify actual variables by passing their addresses.
- Saves memory and improves performance for large data structures.

  4. Pointer to Functions
- Enables dynamic behavior and callbacks.
- Useful in implementing polymorphism and event-driven systems.

5. Building Complex Data Structures
- Essential for implementing linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
- Provides flexibility in memory layout and structure manipulation.

  6. Low-Level System Access
- Pointers allow direct access to memory and hardware registers.
- Crucial in embedded systems and operating system development.

  7. Memory Efficiency
- Avoids copying large structures by passing pointers.
- Enables shared access to data without duplication.
